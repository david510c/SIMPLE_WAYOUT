# Official Greenfield Build - Status Update

## ✅ Build Success!

The official Greenfield compositor built successfully in ~8 minutes!

```
[+] Building 472.6s (37/37) FINISHED
=> naming to docker.io/library/greenfield-official:latest
```

## ✅ Compositor Running!

The official compositor container is healthy and running:

```
NAME: compositor-proxy-official
STATUS: Up (healthy)
PORTS: 0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp
```

**Logs show:**
```
Compositor proxy started. Listening on 0.0.0.0:8081
```

## ⚠️ Issue: SIMPLE_WAYOUT Container

The SIMPLE_WAYOUT container is restarting because its startup script tries to start its own compositor-proxy, which fails with GLIBC error.

**Problem:**
- SIMPLE_WAYOUT's `Dockerfile` includes a `start.sh` that tries to start compositor-proxy
- This was designed for the single-container approach
- With the official two-container setup, SIMPLE_WAYOUT should NOT start a compositor
- It should only run the backend and serve the frontend

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Default docker-compose.yml (Recommended)

The default `docker-compose.yml` works perfectly because it uses the pre-built community image that doesn't have this issue.

```bash
# Stop official build
docker compose -f docker-compose.official.yml down

# Use default (works great!)
docker compose up -d
```

**Why this works:**
- Community image has compositor pre-configured
- SIMPLE_WAYOUT just runs backend
- No GLIBC issues
- Proven, tested setup

### Option 2: Fix SIMPLE_WAYOUT for Two-Container Setup

Create a separate Dockerfile for the two-container setup that doesn't try to start compositor.

**Would require:**
1. New Dockerfile (e.g., `Dockerfile.backend-only`)
2. Modified start.sh that skips compositor startup
3. Update docker-compose.official.yml to use new Dockerfile

**Effort:** Medium
**Benefit:** Can use official Greenfield build

### Option 3: Accept Current Limitation

The official build works for the compositor, but SIMPLE_WAYOUT needs adjustment for two-container setup.

**Current state:**
- ✅ Official compositor: Working perfectly
- ⚠️ SIMPLE_WAYOUT: Needs modification for two-container use

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Build Configuration ✅
Changed from pulling non-existent image to building from source:

```yaml
compositor-proxy:
  build:
    context: ..
    dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile
  image: greenfield-official:latest
```

### 2. Health Check ✅
Fixed health check to look for correct process:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "pgrep", "-f", "compositor-proxy-cli"]  # Was: "node"
```

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Official Greenfield Build | ✅ Success | Built in 8 minutes |
| Compositor Container | ✅ Healthy | Running on port 8081 |
| SIMPLE_WAYOUT Container | ⚠️ Restarting | Tries to start own compositor |
| Overall System | ⚠️ Partial | Compositor works, app needs fix |

## Recommendation

**For immediate use:** Switch to default docker-compose.yml

```bash
# Stop official build
docker compose -f docker-compose.official.yml down

# Use default (works perfectly)
docker compose up -d

# Access
open http://localhost:8080
```

**Why:**
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No GLIBC issues
- ✅ Proven setup
- ✅ Fast deployment

**For official Greenfield:**
- The compositor built successfully and works
- SIMPLE_WAYOUT needs a backend-only Dockerfile
- This would require code changes

## What You Proved

✅ **Official Greenfield builds successfully from source**
✅ **Build time is reasonable (~8 minutes)**
✅ **Official compositor runs correctly**
✅ **Health checks work with correct configuration**

The only issue is that SIMPLE_WAYOUT's Dockerfile was designed for single-container deployment and tries to start its own compositor.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Use What Works)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.official.yml down
docker compose up -d
```

### Future (If You Want Official Build)

1. Create `Dockerfile.backend-only` that doesn't start compositor
2. Update `docker-compose.official.yml` to use it
3. Test the setup

Or just use the community image - it works great and uses the same Greenfield code!

## Files Created

- ✅ `docker-compose.official.yml` - Fixed to build from source
- ✅ `USING_OFFICIAL_GREENFIELD.md` - Complete guide
- ✅ `OFFICIAL_BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Fix explanation
- ✅ `OFFICIAL_BUILD_STATUS.md` - This file

## Summary

**Build:** ✅ Success
**Compositor:** ✅ Working
**Integration:** ⚠️ Needs adjustment

**Recommendation:** Use default `docker-compose.yml` - it works perfectly!

The official build proves that Greenfield can be built from source successfully. For production use, the community image is faster and works out of the box.
