  - Canvas Timing Issues
  - WebSocket Double-Slash Bug
  - WASM Module Incomplete
- Why Docker Image Is Preferred
- Advantages vs Disadvantages

**Key Finding:** Docker is the only reliable way to build and deploy the compositor.

### Part 3: Integration Analysis
**File:** `GREENFIELD_DEPENDENCIES_PART3.md`

**Contents:**
- Can We Integrate Compositor-Proxy into SIMPLE_WAYOUT?
- Three Integration Options Analyzed:
  - Option 1: Include Native Addons (Not Recommended)
  - Option 2: Build Everything from Source (Not Recommended)
  - Option 3: Merge into Single Process (Not Recommended)
- Why Current Architecture Is Better
- Deep Dive - What Compositor-Proxy Actually Does
  - Wayland Server Implementation
  - Buffer Management
  - Video Encoding
  - WebSocket Server

**Key Finding:** Current two-container architecture is optimal. Integration provides no benefits.

---

### Part 4: Recommendations & Conclusion
**File:** `GREENFIELD_DEPENDENCIES_PART4.md`

**Contents:**
- What Could Be Integrated (Theoretical)
  - WebSocket Server (Easy but not worth it)
  - HTTP API (Medium benefit)
  - Session Management (Consider for multi-user)
- What Cannot Be Integrated
  - Native Addons (Impossible)
  - Wayland Server (Impossible)
  - Video Encoding (Very Hard)
- Recommended Architecture
- Final Recommendations
  - For Development
  - For Production
  - For Custom Deployments
  - For Multi-User Systems
- Conclusion and Summary

**Key Finding:** Keep current architecture. Focus on SIMPLE_WAYOUT features, not compositor integration.

- Isolated environment
- Fast deployment
- Easy updates
- Industry standard

### 3. Integration Is Not Worth It
- No performance benefit
- Adds complexity
- Slower builds
- Harder to maintain
- No real advantages

### 4. Current Architecture Is Optimal

- Proven approach

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ DO

1. **Use pre-built compositor image**
   ```yaml
   image: david510c/greenfield-base:v1.5-diagnostic-fixed-v4
   ```

2. **Keep two-container architecture**
   - Compositor container (stable, proven)
   - SIMPLE_WAYOUT container (custom, fast)

3. **Focus on SIMPLE_WAYOUT features**
   - Better UI
   - More applications
   - User management
   - Performance optimization

4. **Treat compositor as black box**
   - It works
   - It's proven
   - Don't touch it

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Don't try to integrate compositor**
   - Takes months
   - Requires C/C++ expertise
   - No benefits
   - High risk

2. **Don't build from source locally**
   - Pollutes system
   - Hard to reproduce
   - Time consuming
   - Error prone

3. **Don't merge into single container**
   - Slower builds
   - Larger image
   - Harder to debug
   - No advantages
